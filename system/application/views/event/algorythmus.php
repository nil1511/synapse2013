		Programming is definitely fun , but when you are up against hundreds of people trying to work out the best possible way to solve the problem , it is one heck of a challenge !! Your result matters less , here what matters is your approach and the speed with which you crack the code !! Algorythmus is about designing an elegant and efficient algorithm that can tackle the complexity and requirement of the problem, producing desired result. Given various problems, the teams will have to work their way through the algorithms and submit their codes respectively. Ranking will be based on number of problems solved, number of attempts and runtime in decreasing order of priority.</p>
