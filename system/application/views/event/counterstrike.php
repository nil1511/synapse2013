			A game is as good as the player.

			Delve into the world of terrorists, Counter Terrorists where your ears pound with the sound of gunshots and bombs. Experience the feeling of running through dangerous maps, while keeping your eyes and ears alert all the time for the possibility of being brutally gunned down by the enemy. It's the biggest counter strike tournament in Gujarat. It's not a game, this one's a war! GO! GO! GO!
