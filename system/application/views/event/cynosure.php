		<p>Raghu Dixit's remarkable rise has been nothing short of spectacular. The former Bharatnatyam dancer's rousing folk rock is not only the symbol of metropolitan India's blossoming alternative music scene, but is also making waves internationally. As Raghu recounts, the music that The Raghu Dixit Project makes, is a true representation of today's India. Ethnic and rooted at the core, but at the same time, global in its outlook. Its not a surprise that Raghu has been referred to as India's biggest cultural export of recent times.</p>
