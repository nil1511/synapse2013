		The various Indian forms
        act like a window to India's rich cultural reservoir. Dance is the form
        of art, wherein the body is used as a medium of communication. Indian
        dances have played an influential role in many other realms of art
        including poetry, sculpture, architecture, literature, music and
        theatre.
