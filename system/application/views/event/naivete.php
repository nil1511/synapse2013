		<p>
		'The Street Play' rolls back the year's usage of open space, fundamental
		right of speech and showcasing an array of acts with socially relevant
		messages from those "olden days".
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Authentic plays aiming at the common man passing by on the street are
		displayed with three Es: Excitement, Energy and Enthusiasm... A tinge of
		imagination, shade of reality and desire to express social awareness is
		what naivete is all about. It is more powerful than any other mode of
		theater because of its proximity between the audience and actors.
