		In whichever form you look at imitation - as the sincerest form of flattery or just a way to get a few laughs at the expense of a ridiculous character. Whatever it is, it takes guts to do so and yes talent is what it requires.
So, here is an opportunity - mock, jeer and extrapolate your perception of your favourite icon, and win laurels and adulation in return.
