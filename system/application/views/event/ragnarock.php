    <div class="pane" style="display:block">
    	<p>There is something every Metalhead craves for inside of himself and that is exactly what RagnaRock 2012 is gonna be all about.<br>
Figure a state of limb-numbing and mental frenzy caused by the cacophonous wall of sound combined with hypersonic double bass rhythms and your heart thumping with the bassline 

constantly urging you to mosh and fu** your own shadow from behind.<br>

The above depiction holds true for the past few RagnaRocks we've witnessed. This year its gonna be even more crazy with bands like Bhayanak Maut and Undying Inc. headlining the 

event alongwith other performers from India.
