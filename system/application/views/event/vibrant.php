		The soul of a movie is the story and stories are best told with the right voice. No
faces, no senses just the voices of the character narrating their story.
		
		It's all about bringing out the voice of the celebrity hidden in you. Get in the groove, mimic the stars and feel the stardom in the claps of the audience!
